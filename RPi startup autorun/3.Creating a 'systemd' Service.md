# Automatically Run a Python Script at Startup on a Raspberry Pi
To configure your Python script to run automatically when your Raspberry Pi starts, you can use systemd, which is the standard initialization system. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### 1. Prepare the Python Script
Make sure your script **_'script.py'_** is placed in the directory **_'/home/srdc-projects/project-name'_** and that it has the correct execution permissions.

### 2. Set Execution Permissions
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory:
```
cd /home/srdc-projects/project-name
```
Set execution permissions for your script:
```
chmod +x script.py
```

### 3. Create a **_'systemd'_** Service File
Create a **_'systemd'_** service file for your script:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/script.service
```
Add the following content to the **_'script.service'_** file:
```
[Unit]
Description='Script' Service #Change 'Script' to your liking
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/srdc-projects/project-name/script.py
WorkingDirectory=/home/srdc-projects/project-name
Restart=always
User=pi  # Change this to the appropriate user if different

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Save and Exit: **_CTRL+X -> Y -> ENTER_**

### 4. Enable and Start the Service
After saving and closing the file, reload the **_'systemd'_** manager to include the new service:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable the service to start automatically at boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable script.service
```

Start the service immediately to check if it works correctly:
```
sudo systemctl start script.service
```

### 5. Check the Service Status
To check the status of the service and ensure there are no errors:
```
sudo systemctl status script.service
```

### 6. Troubleshooting
If the service does not start as expected, view the logs to identify issues:
```
journalctl -u script.service
```
